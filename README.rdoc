= Huddle.RestClient

This is a wrapper over the .NET HttpWebRequest, etc. and particular HTTP methods in order to
make your life easier when developing against the Huddle API in .NET.

== Build

There are no build scripts at the moment, so it's a case of firing up Visual Studio to build.

== Examples

There are several usage examples in the Huddle.RestClient.Examples project in the form of NUnit 
tests.  It's worth pointing out that these examples use URI templating, but the Huddle files API
should not be used in this way.
